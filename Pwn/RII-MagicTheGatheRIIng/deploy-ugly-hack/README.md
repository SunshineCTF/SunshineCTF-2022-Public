This directory was created by kcolley while deploying this challenge. Due to
the core changes to PwnableHarness, as well as the specific requirements to
build the challenge on an Ubuntu 20.04 box (which I did not have handy at the
time), I decided to whip up a quick PwnableHarness project that would copy in
the pre-built challenge binaries (including the core PwnableHarness binaries).
This allowed the challenges to be deployed without needing to build them on
Ubuntu 20.04 or use the custom modified version of PwnableHarness.
