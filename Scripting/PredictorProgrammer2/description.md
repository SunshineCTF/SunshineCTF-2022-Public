# PredictorProgrammer: Another Castle üè∞
## Take that, friends and siblings!

This TIME I have taken a different path.

My CLOCK tells me that you cannot guess the future, as you don't come from a future TIME period.

I may have fixed the bug in the previous predictor challenge. Assuming there was a bug. Anyhow the bug has been censored.

I would never use something so predictable as TIME to predict the future, the future is made of TIME so I would _never_ do such a thing...

It would only give you SECONDS... no... HUNDREDS of MICROSECONDS to figure out what the seed was.

Assuming I didn't do that I would need to give you a couple chances to get it right... But I expect you to have flawless perfection.

Flag will be given by our backend in the standard `sun{}` format!

Visit `predictor-castle.2022.sunshinectf.org 65001`, and play a game of predicting the future!

## Notes

I am not unreasonable.

All I ask is you predict the future with 100% accuracy.

That's hard, that's why I give you a couple chances to get it wrong.

Once you get a few numbers I feel you'll get the hang of it.

Just don't use the previous numbers to predict the state of the RNG, that would totally not be predicting the future, as the state is set from the start, so you'd be predicting the past! And it would _ruin_ the whole concept of this challenge and make it an exercise in math and googling how to break linear congruential generators! That's super boring, this is _strictly_ about predicting the future, which is fun!

## Example Usages

"Hi, I'm thinking of a number from 1 to 31"
```python
7
```
Wrong. Too big! Guess again! You have 6 lives remaining!

...


8
Correct! You've guessed 3 numbers correctly, and have 1 life left! Only 16 more correct answers left to guess!

Note: In the future we may change the support structure if we find there's security issues with them.
